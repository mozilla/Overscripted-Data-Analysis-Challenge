    "Fingerprinting has become [increasingly popular](https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/index.html), given the ease with which websites can access a persons brwoser and system settings/configuration. To generate a unique identifier, websites collect the values of as many browser and system settings as possible to calculate an identifier for that browser. Once generated, a fingerprint can be used by websites and trackers in a number of ways to accomplish a number of different things, including tracking users for business purposes (analytics, marketing, advertising), as well as actually following a user accross the web until it can actually [de-anonymize](https://robertheaton.com/2017/10/17/we-see-you-democratizing-de-anonymization/) them."

Further research (outlined in [The Web Never Forgets](https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/the_web_never_forgets.pdf) confirmed a common basic flow of operations used to fingerprint the canvas, which we were able to apply to this dataset to test for fingerprinting.

    "Some websites use both Canvas `fillText()` and `toDataURL()`. By filling the canvas with text and using toDataURL to get information on how the computer uniquely renders it, the site can tag you as a unique visitor. Usually the fillText() uses a pangram plus a unicode symbol (see below) so that it gets the most renderings for the most unique fingerprint. Interestingly enough, the websites that use a big set of fonts as arguments to filltext may be utilizing a different technique instead of a pangram. In [The Web Never Forgets]() they mention that if the image requested is not in a lossy format, it most likely is a Canvas fingerprint. Image/webp is passed as some of the arguments - webp can be used as a lossless format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CanvasRenderingContext2D.measureText()** was not discussed in the articles but rather was a discovery of our own. A measureText returns a TextMetrics object that returns a calculated width of a segment of inline text in CSS pixels. It takes into account the current font of the context.(Width is the most supported measurement, there are many others that could potentially be used if browser support becomes ubiquitous). By passing a unique string and grabbing the width, it can be used as a replacment as a pangram in fingerprinting. We caught in one of our datasets that Stripe.network in particular was using this technique 58 times along with a fillText and a toDataURL.\n"

Pangrams are used to observe how a computer renders all letters plus usually a unicode item is used too.

    "\n",
    "What we're seeing above are websites that use both Canvas `fillText()` and `toDataURL()`. By filling the canvas with text and using toDataURL to get information on how the computer uniquely renders it, the site can tag you as a unique visitor. Usually the fillText() uses a pangram plus a unicode symbol (see below) so that it gets the most renderings for the most unique fingerprint. Interestingly enough, the websites that use a big set of fonts as arguments to filltext may be utilizing a different technique instead of a pangram. In [The Web Never Forgets]() they mention that if the image requested is not in a lossy format, it most likely is a Canvas fingerprint. Image/webp is passed as some of the arguments - webp can be used as a lossless format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CanvasRenderingContext2D.measureText()** was not discussed in the articles but rather was a discovery of our own. A measureText returns a TextMetrics object that returns a calculated width of a segment of inline text in CSS pixels. It takes into account the current font of the context.(Width is the most supported measurement, there are many others that could potentially be used if browser support becomes ubiquitous). By passing a unique string and grabbing the width, it can be used as a replacment as a pangram in fingerprinting. We caught in one of our datasets that Stripe.network in particular was using this technique 58 times along with a fillText and a toDataURL.\n"
